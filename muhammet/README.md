# Play music, read joke

The pages are all linked with each other and on every page you can go back to the home page. The colors are used to match the main theme of the home page. Every page is responsive and should, at least, look good on smaller screen sizes. Synthesizer will obviously not work because you need a keyboard to play them. That's why the keys are not shown on smaller screens. 

## Synthesizer (+ piano)

A Synthesizer for you to play your favourite 16-bit game music! I use Tone.js library for the sounds and eventlisteners to play the correct tone. So the keys are mapped to notes. Then with eventlisteners the key presses are caught. As long as you press the button the sound will play and after removing it stops.

The synthesizer page is the first version of this idea. After that I created a second version where you can see a keyboard and correct letters on them. When the keys are pressed you can see the keys getting a green color to show which are pressed. 

I want to thank [Sara Mohammad](https://github.com/Sa-raCha) for giving me the idea and encouraged me to not procrastinate and pushed me to implement this updated version.

Using 3 different API's I created buttons (rather modals) to show a random excuse, a random Chuck Norris joke and a Useless Fact -which I find very useful sometimes!
