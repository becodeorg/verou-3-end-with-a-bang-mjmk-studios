## CSS + Framework

Bootstrap v5.1.3 is used for general styling. The colors of primary and secondary buttons are overridden to adjust it to the project theme (iris/orange). The footer and buttons are premade by Muhammet in components.html for everyone's use.

Instead of plain CSS, Sass is used to improve speed and stability. Color variables are stored in seperate .scss file. Sass files support mobile responsiveness with media queries.
